# Summary of Test Coverage Improvements

This work introduced a comprehensive test suite for the Google Apps Script, which previously had no automated tests. This significantly improves the maintainability and reliability of the script.

## Files Modified and Created

*   `Code.gs`: Renamed from `social_media_full_suite.txt` for clarity and to follow standard Apps Script conventions. No code logic was changed.
*   `tests.html`: A new file that contains the QUnit test suite. It includes mock objects for all external services and tests for every function in the script.
*   `qunit.js`: The QUnit library, downloaded to be used in the local test runner.
*   `run_tests.js`: A Node.js script created to execute the test suite from the command line, providing a way to run tests in a CI/CD environment.

## New Test Coverage

A new test suite was created from scratch, providing coverage for the following functions and scenarios:

### `getChatGPTResponse(prompt)`
*   **Success Case**: Verifies that a successful API call to OpenAI returns the expected text content.
*   **Error Case**: Ensures that the function returns `null` and logs an error when the API call fails.

### `createBitlyLink(longUrl)`
*   **Success Case**: Verifies that a successful API call to Bitly returns the correct shortened URL.
*   **Error Case**: Ensures that the function returns `null` and logs an error when the API call fails.

### `generateMultiTabDrafts()`
*   **Core Logic**: Tests the main workflow of generating drafts, ensuring that it correctly reads from the central sheet and creates new tabs for each platform.
*   **Language Handling**: Verifies that content is generated for the correct languages (`EL`, `EN`, `BOTH`) as specified in the central sheet.
*   **Content Parsing**: Ensures that the response from the OpenAI API is correctly parsed into `Hook`, `Κείμενο`, `Hashtags`, and `CTA` and written to the correct cells.
*   **Error Handling**: Confirms that if the OpenAI API call fails, the cells are populated with an error marker (`❌`).

### `generateBitlyLinks()`
*   **URL Shortening**: Verifies that the function correctly identifies rows with original URLs and calls the `createBitlyLink` function.
*   **Idempotency**: Ensures that existing Bitly links are not replaced.

### `updateBitlyClicks()`
*   **Click Tracking**: Verifies that the function correctly fetches and updates the click counts for each Bitly link in the sheet.

### `generatePDFsFromDrafts()`
*   **PDF Generation**: Tests the end-to-end process of creating a Google Doc, populating it with the correct content from the draft sheets, and creating a mock PDF.
*   **File Handling**: Verifies that a new folder is created in Google Drive and that the link to the generated PDF is correctly written back to the central sheet.

By implementing these tests, we can now confidently make changes to the script and verify its correctness automatically, reducing the risk of regressions and bugs.
